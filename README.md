# Etf Analyzer

## Introduction
In this project, we analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF. The ETF data is stored in a SQL database and we use SQL and Python to perform our analysis. We also create an interactive web application using the Voilà library to present our analysis and visualizations.

## Background
Passive investing has become very popular in finance in recent years. Investing in a basket of assets, called an exchange-traded fund (ETF), offers more diversification and less risk than investing in a single stock. In this project, we analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF to understand its growth potential and risk exposure.

## Tools and Technologies
We use the following tools and technologies in this project:

* SQL for data querying
* Python for data analysis and visualization
* Pandas and hvplot libraries for data analysis and visualization
* Voilà library for creating an interactive web application

## Deliverables
The project has the following deliverables:

* Jupyter Notebook containing analysis of the ETF data and interactive visualizations
* Video of the web application created by deploying the Jupyter notebook via the Voilà library

## Project Workflow
* Load the ETF data from a SQL database into a Pandas DataFrame.
* Calculate and visualize the cumulative returns of the ETF portfolio over time.
* Analyze the volatility and risk of the ETF portfolio by calculating the rolling standard deviation and annualized standard deviation.
* Construct and visualize a correlation matrix to analyze the relationships between the ETF portfolio's assets.
* Create an interactive web application using the Voilà library to present the analysis and visualizations.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project allows us to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF using SQL and Python. We use data analysis and visualization techniques to understand the growth potential and risk exposure of the ETF portfolio. We also create an interactive web application to present our findings in an engaging way.
